<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
 
Kassandra, a robust and accurate cell deconvolution tool developed for analysis of healthy tissue and tumor biopsies. Based on RNA-seq NGS data of a biological sample, Kassandra predicts cellular composition including stromal and immune elements by analyzing the gene expression. This will lead to an improved understanding of the tumor microenvironment, which is a critical factor in cancer pathogenesis, clinical outcome, and therapeutic resistance.

Kassandra is a decision tree machine learning-algorithm trained on a collection of over thousands of RNA profiles from various sorted cell types. Performance was validated on over 4,000 H&E tissue slides and more than 1,000 samples comprising normal and tumor tissues by comparison with cytometric, immunohistochemical or single-cell RNA sequencing measurements of the same tissue.
 
<!-- Getting Started -->
## Getting Started
 
"Model Training.ipynb‚Äù provides limited example of training blood deconvolution model. The model is relatively small and can be trained on an average laptop. To reproduce the full publication model use "configs/full_blood_model.yaml" config. It requires 40-60gb of memory for generation of training data. adsf
 
<!-- Data -->
## Data
The example dataset consists of 4 tables in the 'data' folder, two with annotation and two with expressions of cancer cell lines and sorted cells samples. To train full model download data from https://science.bostongene.com/kassandra/downloads.
 
 
<!-- Transcripts to genes -->
## Transcripts to genes
Kassandra deconvolution is trained and can be used on gene TPM expressions obtained by the specific procedure described in the publication methods section. In short there are transcripts and genes that are removed from expressions. Tumor and blood models use slightly different procedures. Both procedures demonstrated in "Model Training.ipynb" notebook.

Inputs in form of gene TPM produced by other tools or procedures different from described above are not recommended.

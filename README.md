<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
 
Kassandra is a robust and accurate cell deconvolution tool developed for the analysis of healthy tissue and tumor biopsies. Based on RNA-seq NGS data of a biological sample, Kassandra predicts cellular composition, including stromal and immune elements, by analyzing gene expression. This will lead to an improved understanding of the tumor microenvironment, which is a critical factor in cancer pathogenesis, clinical outcome, and therapeutic resistance.

Kassandra is a decision tree machine learning algorithm trained on a collection of over thousands of RNA profiles from various sorted cell types. Performance was validated on over 4,000 H&E tissue slides and more than 1,000 samples comprising normal and tumor tissues by comparison with cytometric, immunohistochemical or single-cell RNA sequencing measurements of the same tissue.

<!-- Getting Started -->
## Getting Started
 
"Model Training.ipynb‚Äù provides limited examples of the training blood deconvolution model. The model is relatively small and can be trained on an average laptop. To reproduce the full publication model use "configs/full_blood_model.yaml" config. It requires 40-60 gb of memory for generation of training data.

 
<!-- Data -->
## Data
The example dataset consists of 4 tables in the 'data' folder, two with annotation and two with the expression of cancer cell lines and sorted cell samples. To train the full model, download data from https://science.bostongene.com/kassandra/downloads.
 
<!-- Data processing -->
## Data processing
Kassandra deconvolution is trained and can be used on gene TPM expression obtained by the specific procedure described in the methods section of the manuscript. The number of transcripts has to be removed from expression before it is aggregated to gene expression and renormalized to TPM. Tumor and blood models described in the manuscript use slightly different procedures. Both procedures are demonstrated in "Model Training.ipynb" notebook.

Inputs in the form of TPM produced by other tools or procedures different from described above are not recommended.
